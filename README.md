# FoodApp

We would like to make a program that uses Google Maps to help users find a restaurant. People are usually willing to spend more for higher quality food and less for lower quality food. We will use this idea to rank restaurants for people as a ratio of price and review ratings. If we do make a website version, we would probably restrict access to the amount of free GET Requests we have. Hopefully, we can even use principles in marketing and data analytics to give even better suggestions for what people would want to eat.
